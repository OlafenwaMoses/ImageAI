### Documentation
<div id="documentation"></div>

We have provided full documentation for all **ImageAI** classes and functions in 2 major languages. Find links below:

- Documentation - **English Version**  [https://imageai.readthedocs.io](https://imageai.readthedocs.io)
- Documentation - **Chinese Version**  [https://imageai-cn.readthedocs.io](https://imageai-cn.readthedocs.io)
- Documentation - **French Version**  [https://imageai-fr.readthedocs.io](https://imageai-fr.readthedocs.io)



### Real-Time and High Performance Implementation
<div id="performance"></div>

**ImageAI** provides abstracted and convenient implementations of state-of-the-art Computer Vision technologies. All of **ImageAI** implementations and code can work on any computer system with moderate CPU capacity. However, the speed of processing for operations like image prediction, object detection and others on CPU is slow and not suitable for real-time applications. To perform real-time Computer Vision operations with high performance, you need to use GPU enabled technologies.

**ImageAI** uses the Tensorflow backbone for it's Computer Vision operations. Tensorflow supports both CPUs and GPUs ( Specifically NVIDIA GPUs.  You can get one for your PC or get a PC that has one) for machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms' implementations. To use Tensorflow that supports the use of GPUs, follow the link below :


* FOR WINDOWS - [install_windows](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows)
* FOR macOS - [install_mac](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_mac)
* FOR UBUNTU - [install_linux](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux)


### Projects Built on ImageAI

 ### AI Practice Recommendations
<div id="recommendation"></div>

For anyone interested in building AI systems and using them for business, economic,  social and research purposes, it is critical that the person knows the likely positive, negative and unprecedented impacts the use of such technologies will have.
They must also be aware of approaches and practices recommended by experienced industry experts to ensure every use of AI brings overall benefit to mankind.
We therefore recommend to everyone that wishes to use ImageAI and other AI tools and resources to read Microsoft's January 2018 publication on AI titled "The Future Computed : Artificial Intelligence and its role in society".
