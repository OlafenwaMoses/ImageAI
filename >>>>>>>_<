Hello, Olafewa.
I found a problem in kangvcar/ImageAI_docs about the html href on the pics.
one pic href on "https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/raw/master/images/image2.jpg", but it seems that has been invalid,
"https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/raw/master/images/image2.jpg" looks right.
kangvcar'project latest commit is on the last year, and yours looks newer.
so please contact kangvcar to modify and republish.
Sincerely.
